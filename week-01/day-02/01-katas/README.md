## List of Katas
1. `DayOfWeek`: Write a program that gets user input (an integer) and uses a switch statement to print the associated day of the week. Number 1 should output `Monday`. Number 2 should output `Tuesday`. 8 should output `Invalid Day`.

1. `EvenOrOdd`: Write a program that gets user input (an integer) and prints whether it's even or odd.

1. `HiLo`: Write a program that gets user input (an integer) and prints `Hi` if the number is 10 or higher. Otherwise print `Low`.

1. `YourAgeCan`: Write a program that asks the user's age and then prints out whether that person can:
    * Vote (18+)

1. `AgeAgain`: Write a program that asks for the user's age and then asks a follow-up question based on the value:
    * Less than 14: Ask what grade they're in and then prints "Wow! [user answer] grade - that sounds exciting!"
    * Between 14 and 18 (inclusive): Ask if they're planning to go to college.  If the answer is "yes" (all lowercase), ask what college and then print "[user answer] is a great school!".
