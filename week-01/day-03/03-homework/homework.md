For tonight's homework read the following articles:

These articles will go more in-depth into methods than we will in class. The truth is, we can't cover everything you need to know in 30 hours of class for 12 weeks. It's impossible. You will need to do a considerable amount of independent study over the next 3 months and for the rest of your lives in order to be the best developer you can be. 

Don't just skim through these. Really read them. Are there words you don't know? Look them up; see what new articles you find to read. 

You don't need to know all of this intimately at this point, but the better you understand the tools at your disposal, the more easily and eloquently you'll be able to solve problems in the future.
